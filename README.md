# What the Program Does
>
>This Python program uses a user-friendly interface (GUI) to search for keywords in specific columns of your Excel files. It then lists the results in a new column inserted at your specified location.
>
>Its key feature is that it does not break the file's formatting. The new column automatically copies the width and cell styles (colors, borders, etc.) of its neighbor, while intelligently preserving all existing merged cells.
>
# Core Purpose
>The main purpose of this tool is to automate data insertion into heavily formatted Excel reports, particularly those containing merged cells, custom column widths, and specific cell styles.
>
>In short, it safely and quickly automates a task that would otherwise be time-consuming and prone to corrupting the file's layout when performed manually.
